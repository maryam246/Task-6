# Task-6
## Loops:
When we want to print something multiple time we use loops.
In python we use two types of loops.

1)For loops

For loop to iterate over elements in a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).

2)While loops

While loop is execute as long as the condition is true.
## Loops and control statements(Continue,break,pass)in python:
Control statements can be used if you wish to skip an iteration or stop the execution. The three types of loop control statements in python are break statement, continue statement, and pass statement.
## range VS Xrange in python:
### Range:
Returns a list of integers.

Execution speed is slower.

Takes more memory as it keeps the entire list of elements in memory.

All arithmetic operations can be performed as it returns a list.

In python 3, xrange() is not supported.
### Xrange:
Returns a generator object.

Execution speed is faster.

Takes less memory as it keeps only one element at a time in memory.

Such operations cannot be performed on xrange().

In python 2, xrange() is used to iterate in for loops.
## Chaining comparison in python:
Checking more than two conditions is very common in Programming Languages.
## else with for:
In other programming language 
## switch function:
It is not check all the conditon like for loop.it directly check condition if any case is true then gives output other wise give default value.
## Python itertools:
Python Itertool is a module that provides various functions that work on iterators to produce complex iterators. 
## Python iter() and next()|converting an object in iterator:
The __iter__() function returns an iterator for the given object (array, set, tuple, etc. or custom objects). It creates an object that can be accessed one element at a time using __next__() function.
## Python|difference between iterable and iterator:
### Iterable:
Iterable is basically an object that any user can iterate over.
### Iterator:
Iterator is also an object that helps a user in iterating over another object (that is iterable).
## Generator in python:
In Python, a generator is a function that returns an iterator that produces a sequence of values when iterated over. 

In Python, we can create a generator function by simply using the 'def' keyword and the 'yield' keyword.
## Generator expression in python:
In Python, a generator expression is a concise way to create a generator object.

 A generator expression provides you with a more simple way to return a generator object.
